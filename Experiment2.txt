Below are the experimental runs for the Winnow Update rule with Linear Threshold function with various activation functions.

Algorithm :- Winnow
Function  :- Threshold Function

Data      :- Unit Spherical Distribution

a) Activation function = relu
Total error : 101
average error : 0.404
epsilon :  0.2
Training fail

a) Activation function = tanh
Total error : 85
average error : 0.34
epsilon :  0.2
Training fail

a) Activation function = threshold
Total error : 101
average error : 0.404
epsilon :  0.2
Training fail

I suspect that Winnow cannot PAC Learn on Linear Threshold Function from the above failed results
